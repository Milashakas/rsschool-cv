### About me:
I had been working as a manager for 4 years. It was a good experience, but I decided to give up my job and start to studying everything what I need to get a job as front-end developer. I passed stage 0 with great result and other courses, now I'm learning English language with a tutor and I have a level between intermediate and upper-intermediate.I believe, that in less than in half a year I can find a job as a junior frontend developer and for me it's not important how much money I will earn, and how much time I will pay for my future job.
### Skills:
* HTML
* CSS
* Java Script
### My code:
```
var humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = function(humanYears) {
  let arr=[];
    arr.push(humanYears);
    let catYears=15;
    let dogYears=15;
    
    for (let i=2;i<=humanYears;i++) {
      if (i==2) {
        catYears+=9
      }
      if(i>=3){
        catYears+=4
      }
    }
    
     for (let i=2;i<=humanYears;i++) {
      if (i==2) {
        dogYears+=9
      }
      if(i>=3){
        dogYears+=5
